# Analyzing Pizza Data
These are some webscrapping and data-visulaziation scripts that were used to create the [this](http://www.rossidata.com/pizza) blogpost.
While this was used to analyze pizza, it could be applied to grab data for any fast food. By default it grabs pizza data from http://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/, though selenium would allow you to pull it from any site.
